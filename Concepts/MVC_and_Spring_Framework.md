# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture 

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces.

It separates the application into three interconnected components:

### **Model**

- Demonstrates the data and business logic of the application.

### **View**

- Handles the presentation layer (UI).

### **Controller**

- Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.
- Processes user input, invokes business logic in the Model, and determines the response to the View.


# Spring Framework

Spring Framework is a widely used Java framework for building enterprise applications.

It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications

**Key Features of Spring Framework:**

### Dependency Injection (DI)

- Simplifies object creation and management.
- Promotes loose coupling by injecting dependencies at runtime.

### Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

- Enables modularizing cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management.

### Spring MVC

- Implements the MVC design pattern for building web applications.
- Handles HTTP requests, processes them using controllers, and returns views.

### Spring Boot:

- Provides an opinionated framework to simplify Spring - application development.
- Features auto-configuration and embedded servers like Tomcat.


## Advantages of Spring Framework
- Lightweight and modular design.
- Powerful integration capabilities with other frameworks and libraries.
- Simplified testing with dependency injection.
- Robust transaction management.
