# Good Practices for Software Development

## Review Questions

### Question 1

**Which point(s) were new to you?**\
The practice of joining meetings 5-10 minutes early to interact with teammates was something I hadnâ€™t considered before.

### Question 2

**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**\
I need to improve on over-communicating with my team, especially when facing delays or issues. To improve, I will:

- Proactively inform team members when encountering technical issues or delays.
- Use group chats instead of private messages to keep discussions visible.
- Make sure to confirm and follow up on messages or emails for better clarity.
