## Tiny Habits Reflection

### **Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

In the video by BJ Fogg, the most interesting idea was how small habits can create big changes over time. The concept of starting with something tiny, like flossing just one tooth or doing one push-up, makes building habits feel easy and doable. The idea that motivation is not necessary if you design habits to be small and simple stood out the most. It makes creating new habits feel much more manageable.

### **Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

BJ Fogg explains that behavior (B) happens when motivation (M), ability (A), and prompt (P) come together. This formula means that to make a habit easier to form:

- **Motivation (M)**: How much you want to do the behavior.

- **Ability (A)**: How easy the behavior is to do.

- **Prompt (P)**: A trigger or reminder to start the habit.

To use this formula, you can lower the difficulty (ability) and add a clear prompt to trigger the habit. For example, if you want to start exercising, make it simple by putting your workout clothes next to your bed (prompt) and starting with just 2 minutes of exercise (ability).

### **Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebrating after completing a habit makes you feel good, which helps your brain associate the habit with positive emotions. BJ Fogg calls this "Shine." When you celebrate, you create an emotional reward that reinforces the habit. For example, after brushing your teeth, you can smile in the mirror or say, "I did it!" This positive reinforcement makes the habit more likely to stick.

### **Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

In the "1% Better Every Day" video, the most interesting idea was the concept of small improvements adding up over time. If you improve by just 1% each day, those small gains compound into big results. The story of British cycling coach Dave Brailsford stood out. He focused on making tiny improvements in every part of the team's performance, which led to massive success. This idea shows that small changes can lead to big transformations over time.

### **Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book "Atomic Habits" emphasizes that lasting habits come from changing your identity. Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, focus on who you want to become. For example, instead of saying, "I want to lose weight," say, "I am a healthy person." This mindset shift makes habits more powerful because you act in alignment with your identity.

### **Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.**

The book suggests using the "Two-Minute Rule," which means starting a habit in a way that takes less than two minutes. For example, if you want to start reading, commit to reading just one page. This makes the habit easy to start and reduces resistance. Also, make your environment work for you by putting items related to the habit in plain sight. For example, if you want to drink more water, keep a water bottle on your desk.

### **Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.**

To make a habit harder to do, the book suggests increasing friction or making the environment less convenient. For example, if you want to use your phone less, you can leave it in another room or set app restrictions. The more difficult it is to access the habit, the less likely you are to do it. Also, making the habit unattractive by focusing on its negative effects can reduce the desire to engage in it.

### **Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive, or the response satisfying?**

I want to meditate more often. To make this habit easier:

- **Cue**: Place a meditation cushion in a visible spot.

- **Attractive**: Use a guided meditation app that I enjoy.

- **Easy**: Start with just 2 minutes a day.

- **Satisfying**: Celebrate after meditating by saying, "I did it!" and reflecting on how calm I feel.

### **Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?**

I want to reduce my social media usage. To make this habit harder to do:

- **Cue**: Remove social media apps from my home screen.

- **Unattractive**: Remind myself of the time wasted on social media.

- **Hard**: Set a password for the apps and ask someone else to keep it.

- **Unsatisfying**: Track my screen time and celebrate when I reduce it.
