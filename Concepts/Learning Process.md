### Que. 1) What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you explain a topic in simple words as if teaching a child, to improve clarity.

### Que. 2) What was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea from Barbara Oakley's TED Talk "Learning How to Learn" is the concept of focused and diffuse modes of thinking. She explains how our brain switches between these two modes. Focused mode helps us concentrate on the task at hand, while Diffuse mode allows for creativity and problem-solving by making connections in the background. This balance is crucial for effective learning and solving complex problems.

### Que. 3) What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
Both modes complement each other for effective learning and problem-solving.

- **Active (Focused) Mode:** This is when your brain concentrates intensely on solving a problem or learning something specific. It's deliberate, logical, and uses familiar pathways in your brain, like solving a math problem step by step.

- **Diffuse Mode:** This is when your brain relaxes and processes information more broadly. It's less structured and allows for creativity and big-picture thinking, often connecting ideas in new ways, like when daydreaming or coming up with insights while walking.

### Que. 4) What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
- **Deconstruct the skill:** Break it down into smaller, manageable sub-skills.

- **Learn enough to self-correct:** Gather basic information to identify and fix mistakes.

- **Remove practice barriers:** Eliminate distractions and obstacles to focus.

- **Practice deliberately:** Commit to focused and consistent practice for at least 20 hours.

### Que. 5) What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- **Set clear goals:** Decide exactly what you want to learn and why.

- **Break it down:** Divide the topic into smaller, simpler parts to focus on one step at a time.

- **Practice regularly:** Dedicate time every day to practice and improve.

- **Remove distractions:** Create a quiet and focused environment to stay on track.

- **Take breaks:** Use breaks to let your brain relax and process information.

- **Learn from mistakes:** Donâ€™t fear errors. Use them to figure out where to improve.

- **Stay curious:** Keep asking questions and exploring new ideas.
