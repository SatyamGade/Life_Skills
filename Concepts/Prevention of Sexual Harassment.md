### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment happens when someone behaves inappropriately in a sexual way that makes others feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or disrespected.

Examples:

**Unwelcome Comments:** Making sexual jokes, comments, or remarks about someone's appearance, clothing, or body.

**Touching Without Consent:** Any physical contact like touching or hugging someone without their permission.

**Sexual Advances:** Asking for sexual favors, or pressuring someone into a relationship.

**Sharing Inappropriate Content:** Showing or sending sexual pictures, videos, or messages without the other person's consent.

**Staring or Gestures:** Making lewd gestures or staring at someone in a way that makes them uncomfortable.

**Threats or Blackmail:** Threatening to harm someone's career, reputation, or opportunities if they don't agree to sexual demands.

**Creating a Hostile Environment:** Spreading rumors, making someone feel excluded, or fostering a work or social environment that is unsafe or disrespectful.


### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

It's essential to take such matters seriously, ensure safety, and promote a respectful environment for everyone.

**Speak Up:** If you feel safe, tell the person to stop. Be clear that their behavior is inappropriate and unacceptable.

**Report the Behavior:** Inform a trusted authority, such as your manager, HR department, depending on where the incident occurred.

**Support the Victim:** If you witness harassment, support the person affected. Encourage them to speak up and report the behavior.

**Follow Policies:** Check your workplace's policy on sexual harassment and follow the procedures for reporting.

**Seek Help:** If the behavior continues or you feel unsafe, consider reaching out to legal authorities or organizations that help with harassment cases.

**Stay Confidential:** Respect the privacy of those involved and avoid gossiping about the incident.
